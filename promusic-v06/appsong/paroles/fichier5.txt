Over the edge, feeling like I am floating through the edge
The pain I felt paid for, all is said and done
I am restricted, fix the bomb the web
I need to kick the habit that my mind is breathing in...
Break all I've got to see
Spam all my life holding, all off it closely
I'll playing innocent, a fear discontent
I am falling facing it all, fearless
Burning the brige that keeps us
I'm hearing, I'm feeling, feelings
Exaggerating, that's that you assume
The story is over and now I must come clue
I am conflicted, watching where I step still
Hanging in a balance, not the life I want to live
I want to take it all, standing tall, fear person you are
Break all I've got to see
Spam all my life holding, all off it closely
I'll playing innocent, a fear discontent
I am falling facing it all, fearless
