[Hook]
Talk slick for the kids in the way
Got about 3 side hoes in the condo
And they all want a piece of the day
Could give 2 fucks 'bout a bitch in the shadow
3 months and they all wanna talk now
I'm a change ass kid for the heat now
Got your main ass bitch on speed dial
Bout 3 damn fucks I don't give now

[Verse 1]
Why they talking for the thousandth time bitch know your place, yuh
I got some shit to do and niggas stay in all my case, yuh
That's when I look to you
Ass so fat I'm such a fool
Nigga please don't look my way
Please don't look my way
Please don't look my way
I don't know where to go
People talking on the low
Lots to show that's how you know
I been that kid from head to toe
Why you always talking slow
I got plenty other bitches fuck the snitches
I don't want no business with no fucking fools
Cash, I'm gettin', 24/7
Bitch ass niggas tryna take my settin'
Pussy ass kids tryna break my cool
No respect for the trends I'm settin'
You don't know my codename
Stole yo bitch she so lame
Tried to swish that's okay
I'll catch you fucked up one day

[Verse 2]
Lowkey but I fuck her with the lights on
Look back see the cops got the chase on
Got the whole damn place on, place on
I'm outside on the fence put the tape on
Don't try my side, nigga
Can't trust no fuck nigga
Drop top pink lights in the bag
She ain't never gon' fuck for the cash
Cause she's so sexy, yuh
She stay flexin', yuh
I stay flossin', yuh
She just so unfair
I don't really care
Got my niggas, yuh
Don't press triggas, yuh
I stay pretty, yuh
You a trifling hoe
Ditch yo trifling soul, ditch it

Check the board I'm a colder man
Check the rink I'm a colder man
Lots of ice I'm a colder man

Check yourself thought I told ya, man
Check the bands on my shoulder, man
